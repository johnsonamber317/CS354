For all cache simulations, use a capacity of 16384 bytes, and set associativity of 1, for both
the I-cache and the D-cache.

Sample command line:
pin-fw/pin -injection child -t pin-fw/source/tools/Memory/obj-ia32/allcache.so -is 16384 -ia 1 -ib 64 -ds 16384 -da 1 -db 4 -- cache1D

1.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 4 bytes?

        Data cache misses: 1509073
        Data cache references: 12045594

1.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 4 bytes? (12045594 - 1509073)/12045594 = 0.8747


2.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 32 bytes?

        Data cache misses: 1505319 

        Data cache references: 12045594

2.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 32 bytes? (12045594 - 1505319)/12045594 = 0.8750


3.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?

        Data cache misses: 1507281
        Data cache references: 12045594

3.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes? (12045594 - 1507281)/12045594 = 0.87486 


4. For this question, assume that the 100,000 element integer array that you allocated starts at address 0x50000000 in memory, the size of an integer is 4 bytes and the D-cache is initially empty. As you read the integers in the array one-by-one, starting at index 0, how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 40 integers when the cache block size is (to be answered without running pin):


a) 4 bytes: 5

b) 32 bytes: 5

c) 64 bytes: 5

5. For this program, which block size is best? Why? What is the relationship between the blocksize and hit ratio? Why? 64 bytes because it has the highest hit ratio. The bigger the block size, the higher the hit ratio because one miss will produce (n-1) hits.

6.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?

        Data cache misses: 1508052
        Data cache references: 12045594

6.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes? (12045594 - 1508052)/ 12045594 = 0.8748

7.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?

        Data cache misses: 106899
        Data cache references: 12058093

7.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes? (12058093 - 106899)/ 12058093 = 0.9911

Comparing cache2Drows with cache2Dcols

8. For this question, assume that the 2-D integer array you allocated starts at address 0x40000000 in memory, the size of an integer is 4 bytes, D-cache block size is 64 bytes and the D-cache is initially empty. As you read the integers in the 2-D array one-by-one, starting with element array[0,0], how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 10 integers in case of (to be answered without running pin):

a) cache2Drows: 5
b) cache2Dcols: 1

9. Compare the performance (hit ratio) of the D-cache for the 2 programs. Briefly explain what you observe. They missed the same amount of instructions, but because of the way the two loops were nested, they missed about the same amount of instructions, but that had a greater effect on cache2Drows than cache2Dcols.
